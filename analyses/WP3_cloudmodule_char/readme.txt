# WP3 Cloud Module Characterization

Code to:
* isolate P-3 data in cloud module time intervals, 
* get key altitudes for each cloud module (e.g. LCL, trade inversion bottom)
* generate mean vertical profiles of thermodynamic quantities.


## To do:
Import / revise code to generate the cloud module times / legs tables. Make sure 
they both include a column for 'num_cld_iop'.
