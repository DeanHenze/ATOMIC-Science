2,620,484,2300,2500,Very weak trade inversion.

5,620,581,1390,,"Well-defined trade inversion bottom but poorly defined top from the dropsonedes, likely because the P-3 did not fly high enough."
6,630,710,1900,2250,"Trade inversion top not well defined from the dropsondes, likely because the P-3 did not fly high enough. However, trade inversion bottom is well defined."

8,730,685,1700,,Trade inversion either weak or not well defined.

12,550,577,1800,,"Trade inversion bottom barely defined and top is not defined. There is a moist layer above the trade cumulus layer, which likely explains the ill-defined inversion."

14,650,742,2625,2800,"Strong trade inversion at quoted values, but a much weaker inversion also occurs around 2200 m. Could be a moist layer erasing the original, lower inversion?"
15,750,722,1900,2300,Weak trade inversion.
16,,525,2000,2250,Mixed layer not well defined - there are q and theta gradients down to the surface. Trade inversion also poorly defined. Looks like there could be several very small inversions.
